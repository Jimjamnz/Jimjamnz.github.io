<p style = "padding-bottom:50px;">There is a new left forming, both in New Zealand and elsewhere, with the coming-of-age of Generation Z. This is a contemporary example of the real left, the radical, revolutionary left (from Ernesto Guevara
to Marx, the Zapatistas, the Communards, Sartre, Lenin & the Bolsheviks, Abbie Hoffman, Gramsci, Rosa Luxemburg and more). This publication is but one branch of this new left, serving as
one of many places where these radical ideas can be written and shared. We seek nothing less than the total destruction of the global economic system of capitalism, and we are willing to do 
whatever is nessecary to put this exploitative, destructive and tyranical system in the dustbin of history where it belongs. We are the class struggle Marx wrote about; we are the continuation
of the hundreds of years of working class fighters before us, and we will draw from all relevant sources to take the power back!</p>
